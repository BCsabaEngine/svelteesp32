# Example platformio project

This folder contains a buildable minimalistic project. An example shows how to use the header file in a platformio project. It also works as a native ESP-IDF project.

It can be built on both web servers with the following command (if platformio is installed).

```bash
~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio run -d ./demo/esp32idf
```
