# Svelte DEMO app

This is a DEMO application that serves the purpose of being able to demonstrate the capabilities of SvelteESP32.

With minimal functionality, it can emulate a working Svelte application, which has the translated application in the DIST folder, which can be installed on the ESP32. Thus, ESP32 can serve this reactive application consisting only of HTML, JS and CSS files.
